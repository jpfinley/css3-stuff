CSS3 Stuff

This project was made as a knowledge adventure about the trickery available with CSS3 features currently available in today's browsers (that is, January 2008). Download (or clone the repo), open index.html in your web browser, and click on a feature page. Your experience will most likely deffer depending on which browser you choose. Have fun!
